It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.","indicator_name":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","target":"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","target_id":"8.5","title":"Unemployment rate, by sex","un_custodian_agency":"International labour organization (ILO)","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Labour Force Survey","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Population and Housing Census","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity.
